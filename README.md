# Inverse Kinematic
This project focuses on creating a custom inverse kinematics (IK) system within 
a chosen game engine. The implementation will utilize one of two
algorithms: Cyclic Coordinate Descent (CCD) or Jacobian Inverse Kinematics.

## Getting Started
Clone from [Github](https://github.com/Vincent-Devine/Inverse_Kinematics) *by ssh*
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Vincent-Devine/Inverse_Kinematics.git
```

## Usage Guide
Main scene: **Scenes/SampleScene** <br>
IK algorithms: **CCD** <br>

1. Demonstration <br>

![GIF](./Screenshot/ik_demonstration.gif)
Start the scene to demonstrate inverse kinematics in action. When the player gets near a wall, their hand automatically reaches out to touch it.<br>
This interaction works only when the player is within touching range but not too close.<br>

Player controls: **W, A, S, D** for movement and the **mouse** for camera rotation.<br>

2. Free trial <br>
